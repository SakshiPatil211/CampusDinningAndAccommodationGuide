    <h3>Campus Dining and Accommodation Guide</h3>

    <p>
    This web application is designed to help new students easily find suitable places to eat and stay near the campus. 
    It provides a user-friendly platform where students can register, search for nearby PG accommodations and mess options, 
    and view detailed profiles with ratings and comments from other users.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This app is especially helpful for first-year students who are unfamiliar with the campus area. 
    It saves time and effort by presenting all available options in one place and making informed decisions based on feedback from peers.
